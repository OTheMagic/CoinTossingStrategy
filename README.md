# CoinTossingStrategy
This repository aims to solves a coin tossing problem with winning probability over 50%.\
The coin tossing problem is described as follows:
1. A coin is tossed $n$, an even number, times.
2. Two people A and B are to guess the results. A only knows the results of odd number tossing and is to guess a random positive even number less than n, and B only knows the results of even number tossing and is to guess a random positive odd number less than n. If the odd number A guessed and the even number B guessed have the same coin tossing results, then A and B win, that is: if A guesses 6, and B guesses 5.
3. A and B cannot communicate, but they can come with a strategy before the game starts to achieve a high winning rate. What will be a good strategy that grant a winning rate over 50%? And what's the highest possible winning rate?\

   
So far, we have acheived a 2/3 winning rate with our function in python.
